**Zettelkasten Exploration Analogy**

​    218 - Zettelkasten as a Knowledge Explorer  One way to better understand and think about the purpose is to compare it to an explorer. The index is your original port  city, the biggest hub where information is located and a place to branch off from. You aren’t just any explorer though, you also happen to be a cartographer.  Setting up outposts for further exploration. Output is a byproduct of the interaction between what he put in the  zettelkasten, his default brain, and how the two communicated with each  other.



1. **Reading Log.**  I really liked the idea of using Obsidian as a sort of Resonance Calendar when I read about them, so I’ve started using the Daily Notes & Calendar plugins to keep track of impactful media that I consume. I try to make sure I give a link and a top-level  summary of my major takeaways, because I rarely process these into  “proper” notes — the content is typically things I found interesting and relevant but taking formal notes on every interesting thing I learn  would not only be redundant, it would be a Sisyphean task of Herculean  proportions. Instead, I make sure my summary has enough information to  let me find it again if I need to, and then at the end of the month, I  concatenate all of my Reading Log notes (using this nifty javascript  that I’m working on turning into a plugin) into a single roundup file,  sort through everything to see if it really was worth sharing and  retaining, and then turn it into a blog post  [like this reading roundup 85](https://eleanorkonik.com/january-2021-reading-roundup/).

2. My reading roundups *also* include things I sought out deliberately for learning, and in those cases I usually create a **literature note** (in folder `53`). My literature notes are comprised primarily of highlights and  annotations; after I’m finished reading something, I export the  highlights and annotations and then reformat them to have descriptive  headings and numerical identifiers (typically based on chapter and  page/location) for easier interlinking. I try to *always* include a note for why I thought something would be useful, so my literature  notes tend to be several thousand words along the lines of:

3. **Matching**. Once I have a couple of different pieces  of information that connect to each other on a particular topic (often  from the same literature note, but sometimes I’ll come across something  that relates to a different piece of information I found), I’ll create a new note with a descriptive title *that makes the statement the references prove* and put it into my `56 Synthesis` folder. In most ways, the title is the important part. Then I’ll  transclude all of the relevant “academic” notes on that topic so I can  see them in one place. If it’s only one or two short things, I’ll leave  it alone for efficiency’s sake. But once it’s unwieldy, I’ll start  synthesizing things in one of two ways.

4. **Indexes.** I find the term “Map of Content” to be  pretty … fraught, so I like to avoid it. But I create an index whenever I have a concept that I’ve got a bunch of information about. My [weekly research roundup newsletter 34](https://eleanorkonik.com/subscribe/) gets saved off into a specialty folder because of the formal formatting I use, but they’re designed to be narrowly-focused deep overviews of my research on a particular topic, like wool or beetles or aerogels. I  write articles for my blog basically whenever I feel like I have an  insight worth sharing. I have reference notes and synthesis notes and…  well, information gets spread out. So my index notes are a good place to link to information on a topic *and summarize what that link contains* so I can get an easy, top-down view of my own notes as needed. This is  where Obsidian’s search really shines, because sometimes I find stuff I  had forgotten about, lol.

5. If I only have academic sources on a particular topic, though, and there are a bunch of them, I’ll usually create properly **synthesized** note, although the title is still the most important thing. To be  honest, I do this rarely — and usually purposefully (i.e. when I’m  specifically looking into something like Mesopotamian clothing), not  because I found a spontaneous connection. I find the idea of the “atomic note” to be largely irrelevant to me thus far; I prefer to think of the Zettelkasten ideal as “insights” or “epiphanies” and in terms of what I do, they’re relatively rare and more importantly almost always wind up  being fleshed out into an article of some kind — or they’re so short and self-evident that I never get beyond a descriptive title with some  reference links as sources.

6. More often, though, ideas I have wind up in `91 Seeds` (or `55 Questions!`) because ultimately, I like writing articles. I am a verbose person and I like sharing my thoughts with the world (obviously). So if a thought  about history strikes me while reading, and it could be useful for  worldbuilding or might be able to find an audience (which is almost  always) I usually want it down in pre-production, not languishing in my  “notes.” I even have a little “Article & Blog Idea” step file that I use to collect backlinks on literature notes and resonance calendar  when I don’t have the energy to create the seed. Then, once I have  enough sources or angles for a particular seed to push it to the point  where it’s worth tackling — or inspiration strikes — I usually open up a different markdown app, like Writemonkey or Typora, in one window, and  my obsidian vault in the other, and then open up all of my relevant  notes in Obsidian and start writing, or, secretly, sometimes I use  obsidian mobile to dictate a draft using voice text.

   Then, once I’m done, I go update the relevant `51 Index` notes.





#### Daily Notes

```
### {{date:dddd}} {{date:M/D}}
This makes up a portion of [[{{date:YYYY MMMM}}]]

#### Todo
- [ ] Hiya, Buddy!

#### Things that happened
- An occurrence or event

#### TIL
- Something I learned or of which I was informed

#### Questions

I fill in the gaps in between. Daily notes are a catch-all for me -  they can include my own summaries/analysis of interesting articles,  simply links to articles that may be interesting later with a few copied highlights, or the beginning musings of rough drafts of “real” notes  (even as short as a simple questions to look into further). I try to  review daily notes once per week, but otherwise don’t worry about their  longevity, with the assumption that whatever has merit will be converted into something more durable.

The key point for me is the #daily tag, which allows for easy filtering out of the graph and search.



#### Seedbox

It allows me to create a new note at any time with no fear of  “muddling” my curated notes. There doesn’t need to be any analysis  paralysis trying to decide how the note should be organized: it doesn’t  matter, yet.

It creates a natural separation between curated and uncurated  knowledge and ideas: if an item is outside my Seedbox, I know it has  received at least a baseline of consideration, and I know it has proven  itself valuable at least once in the past. In this metaphor, “seeds” are captured ideas. When you put a seed into  your seedbox, you are “planting” it, in the hopes that it will grow into an Understanding. The
