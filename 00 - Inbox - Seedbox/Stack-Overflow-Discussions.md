### What is linting @debugging

,
## Linting is the process of checking the source code for Programmatic as well as Stylistic errors. This is most helpful in identifying some common and uncommon mistakes that are made during coding.

A Lint or a Linter is a program that supports linting (verifying code quality). They are available for most languages like JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Python, etc..

I would like to add that, Linting will run through your source code to find

-  formatting discrepancy
-  non-adherence to coding standards and conventions
-  pinpointing possible logical errors in your program

Running a Lint program over your source code, helps to ensure that source code is legible, readable, less polluted and easier to maintain.





### Language Differences

If you organie by categories you'll find programmers use different


Even if you break down programming into a category, such as Web programmer, the same principle holds true. The Web programmer needs to know at least one Web programming language, but it could be PHP, Python, Perl, Ruby, or whatever. Since each can be substituted for the other, none is required.

For inspiration

Unless you mean which are the top five programming languages that programmers should learn for inspiration.

In that case, I would still answer none.

As an analogy, someone might ask, what are the languages I should learn to speak better English? Should I learn Chinese, Japanese, French, Spanish, or Russian in the hope that the grammar of those languages would inspire me to write better English?


For generality
So I would recommend:

- one classical compiled language, like C++ or C
- one modern compiled language, like Rust, Swift, or Go
- one bytecode language, like Java or C#
- one scripting language, like Python or PHP
- one DOM scripting language, like JavaScript
