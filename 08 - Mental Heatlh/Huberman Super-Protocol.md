## 9 Step Protocol for Accelerated Learning & Neuroplasticity

Per Dr. Andrew Hubermans Logitech Conference for Educators. 

### 1.  Get alert
You need to be aware and alert and attempting to learn. You need alertness to get focused. 

### 2.  Get focused
Alertness and focus combined allow us to be motivated. 

A white noise sound in the background can stimulate this motivation by creating optimum brain conditions. 

If you draw or focus on a visual target from the distance someone will be learning and have them focus for 10-15s without blinking. This brings online the chemicals that bring along elevated alert and focus naturally just like if your stressed or excited you know you can focus in a millisecond.
  
### 3.  Generate repetitions. (As many as you safely can in a given block). 
Keep referring to the material being learned and focus in on them by interoggating what your learning. This includes practice questions or skill exercises. Safety margins vary from music to running hurdles.
 

### 4.  Expect & Embrace Errors. 
Errors creates heightened activity in the pre frontal cortex. Your attention increases when you miss, then your perception increases trying to fine tune the right action.

After 25 your brain needs active error correction to engage with neuroplasticity. 

### 5.  Randomly Insert Micro-Rest Intervals
Donâ€™t worry on optimal ratios, just introduce at random. This allows the brain to consolidate memory at 20x pace than normal by taking attention away shortly. 
  
### 6.  Random intermittentant reward
Sometimes the best reward is no reward at all. It can undermine learning.

Dopamine reward prediction error. The more you experience that reward the more potent the next reward is gonna have to be higher.

### 7.  Limit Learning Trigger sessions to 90m or less (Space 2-3 Hours Apart)
The brain has a high caloric intake.

The molecules of alertness have a bias towards moving and agitation that are healthy forms of alertness. Then incorporate 

### 8.  Incorporate NSDR Protocols (10-30m). Post learning trigger sessions. 

For sake of enhancing plasticity and alertness. 

If naps interfere with your ability to sleep later you can do a non active task like going for a walk.

### 9.  Maximize Quality & Optimal durations of sleep that night (& The next).
