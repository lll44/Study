# DistributedScrum 
Distributed scrum team 
: a scrum team that is either fully or partially remote.

Constraints on ad hoc collaboration and informal communication, remote teams need to be more disciplined about their scrum rituals and create new opportunities for bonding and collaboration.

Normally 2 pizza rule for teams in person (7-10 people/ team), but (5-6) for a distributed 

## Benefits
- Wider pool of available talent that can increase skill sets of teams
- Teams across geographies that allows for 24-hour workday

> “Remote teams that closely follow recommended agile technical practices could easily outperform a colocated team that does not”, according to Gartner

## Challenges
Communication: 
- Without informal hallway chats and impromptu in-person meetings, remote teams need to communicate more and, at times, over communicate. 
- Communicating time should be based in one time zone.
- Remote workers may have feelings of isolation, less team unity, and miss social interaction with work colleagues, less comraderie.
- Project knowledge can be scattered since it’s more challenging for remote teams to share information.

## Building a successful Remote Team
A remote scrum team needs clear communication, transparency, mutual trust, collaboration, and a dedication for continuous improvement. 

A Distrubuted Scrum Team Communication Plan
- Remote work agreements
-   A way to contact other team members for informal questions  
-   Establish agreements for how meetings should be structured
-   How team members communicate their availability
-   What collaboration tools should be used

### Collaboration Tools
Agile teams use agile planning tools for collect stories/requirements, report and manage issues, and to track progress and quality.

-   Be accessible to all team members
-   Enable collaboration, sharing, and notifications to team members 
-   A collection of relevant, engaging information

### Impromptu chats
quick water cooler chats disappear with remote work, it’s important to allow for these informal communication channels to exist. 
If you use Slack, you can create specific channels with different intents. 
The scrum master should keep open communication channels to each part of the scrum team, as well as facilitate communication with the team as a whole.

build a united development culture by:
-   Over-communicating decisions across all geographies
-   Minimizing the friction in setting up the development environment
-   Clearly defining the definition of done
-   Creating guidelines for filing effective bug reports

### Daily scrum meetings
These short, daily team meetings provide a quick forum for a distributed team that helps with focus, collaboration, communication, and problem-solving.
-Schedule regular video conferencing.
-Hold asynchronous stand-ups where team members use Slack to check-in or comment on their work board to share updates.

structure for our stand-ups:
-   What did I work on yesterday?
-   What am I working on today?
-   What issues are blocking me?

### Product backlog

It’s important that the features of the sprint backlog are clearly documented and “definition of ready” agreed upon.
If product backlog items are ambiguous, the team may lose momentum and the time to resolution can be delayed.

### Self organization

Team members can **take responsibility** for achieving business goals and how they are contributing to it. 
**Provide visibility** by documenting expectations on a Confluence page and agree how to hold each member accountable.

# Roles
## What are the three scrum roles?

Scrum has three roles: 
- product owner 
- scrum master 
- development team members.

## Scrum roles vs job titles
- They aren’t job titles.
- The three roles give a minimum definition of responsibilities and accountability to allow teams to effectively deliver work.
- Allows teams to take responsibility for how they organize and to keep improving themselves.

## Building a scrum team
Scrum Framework provides the basic structure for regular meetings, artifacts, and who does what.
Its not a one size fits all solution, the problems are different, the team structures and skills needed are also different.

## The development team: Redefining “developer”
- The development team can be comprised of all kinds of people including designers, writers, programmers, etc. 
- A team member who has the right skills, as part of the team to do the work.
- should be able to self-organize so they can make decisions to get work done.
- empowering the people closest to the work to do what’s needed to solve the problem.
![A diagram showing the development team's responsibilities: Self organization, design, development, UX, testing, deployment.](https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:f085fea0-5149-4b9a-9fe1-7e9fd32dc0da/Scrum-Development%20team-revised.png?cdnVersion=1717)

The development team’s responsibilities include:
-   Delivering the work through the sprint.
-   Ensuring Transparency at daily scrum.

**Daily Scrum**
: provides transparency to the work and provides a dedicated place for team members to seek help, talk about success and highlight issues and blockers, to inspect and adapt the work they are doing and work in a more effective way.

## The product owner: Setting clear direction
Product owners:
-ensure that they are delivering the most value
-represents the business
-tells development what is important to deliver
- trust is needed between these 2 roles.
- understand the customer
- have a vision for the value the scrum team is delivering to the customer.
- balances the needs of other stakeholders in the organization.
- must take all these inputs and **prioritize the work**.

Agile teams are designed to inspect and adapt, that means a change in priority may lead to a massive change to the team structure, work products, as well as the end result.

product owners responsibilities as:

**Managing the scrum backlog** 
- does not mean that they are the only one putting in new product backlog Items into the backlog. 
- responsible for the backlog that the development team pulls to deliver from. 
- They should know about everything that is in the backlog. 
- other people that add items to the product backlog should ensure that they communicate with the product owner.

**Release management** 
- The sprint is a planning cycle. 
- Scrum teams can deliver at any time. Ideally, they would deliver frequently throughout the sprint allowing the sprint review to review real customer usage and feedback. 
- Continuous delivery is not always possible, and other release models are required.
- Product owner must know when things can and should be released.

**Stakeholder management** 
- Any product will have many stakeholders from users, customers, governance and organizational leadership. 
- The product owner will work with all these people to effectively ensure that the development team is delivering value. 
- A large amount of stakeholder management and communication is required.

# Agile Scrum Artifacts
**Agile scrum artifacts** 
: information that a scrum team and stakeholders use to detail the product being developed, actions to produce it, and the actions performed during the project. 

The main agile scrum artifacts are 
-product backlog, sprint backlog, and increments.

## Why Agile scrum artifacts
These artifacts provide metadata points that give insight into the performance of a sprint. 
They are essential tools for every scrum team since they enable core scrum attributes of transparency, inspection, and adaption.

Artifacts are created during the main activities of a scrum [sprint](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/sprints): 

-   Plan work and future goals
-   Create tasks to achieve these goals
-   Organize tasks into sprints based on dependency and priority
-   Execute the tasks
-   Review and analyze results in order to compare to the goals
-   Repeat these steps

## The main artifacts of agile scrum

![Scrum artifacts](https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:05c5e42e-3df4-4168-8fe3-ac1656ca76ed/scrum-artifacts.png?cdnVersion=1717)

The main agile scrum artifacts are product backlog, sprint backlog, and increments.

### Product backlog

The [product backlog](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/backlogs) is: 
- a list of new features, enhancements, bug fixes, tasks, or work requirements needed to build a product. 
- Compiled from input sources like customer support, competitor analysis, market demands, and general business analysis.
- a “live” artifact in that it is updated on-demand as new information is available. 
- a cross-team backlog that is maintained and curated by the product owner between sprint cycles and as any new ideas arise. 
- Contains tasks that were once in an active sprint but deprioritized and moved to the backlog.

### Sprint backlog

**Sprint backlog** : a set of product backlog tasks that have been promoted to be developed during the next product increment. 
- Created by the development teams to plan deliverables for future increments and detail the work required to create the increment.  
- Created by selecting a task from the product backlog and breaking that task into smaller, actionable sprint items. 
- The product backlog is home to the primary task while the supporting tasks are housed in the sprint backlog.

-The sprint backlog is updated during the [sprint planning](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/sprint-planning) phase of scrum. 
-The smaller sprint tasks are assigned to the relevant teams like design and development. 
-If a team does not have the capacity to deliver all the sprint tasks, the remaining sprint tasks will standby in the sprint backlog for a future sprint.

### Product increment

**Product Increment** 
:the customer deliverables that were produced by completing product backlog tasks during a sprint, including the increments of all previous sprints. 

-There is always one increment for each sprint and an increment is decided during the scrum planning phase. 
-An increment happens whether the team decides to release to the customer. 
-Product increments are incredibly useful and complementary to CI/CD in version tracking and, if needed, version rollback.

### Extended artifacts

In addition to the previously discussed official scrum artifacts, there exist some extended or meta artifacts. While not official per official scrum guidelines these extended artifacts add additional value and insight to a scrum cycle.

#### Burndown chart

**Sprint Burndown (or burnup) chart** 
- not an official scrum artifact but used to communicate and track progress toward the sprint goal during the sprint. 
- They are graphs that display tasks completed over the duration of a sprint. 
- useful in helping to gauge the active execution velocity of a team so they can reprioritize if the trajectory is off.
- During sprint planning, teams shouyld look at previous burns. 
- Over time burndown charts help teams better refine their estimates during the planning stages of scrum.

#### The definition of “done”

- It’s important that teams have a clear definition of **“done”**.
- This definition can be another type of artifact, which should be documented and shared. 
- An example definition of done for a development team is when code is covered with automated tests that match a specification and is deployed to a production environment. 
- A team without a clear definition of done will find themselves often in sprint review asking “is this done?” when reviewing open scrum tasks.
- The definition of done helps define the boundaries of an **increment**. 
- **Increments** should be delivered in complete usable packages that are additive to increments that came before. 
- **Done** also defines when tasks are complete and can be closed out for burndown tracking.

## Artifact transparency

**Scrum artifacts** are powerful aids that help teams operate more efficiently. 
- All teams should have access and visibility into the artifacts.
-  Product owners and scrum masters need to make it a regular practice to review and discuss artifacts with development teams. 
-  This helps teams stay aware of operational inefficiencies and produce creative ways to improve velocity.
# Scrum metrics
**Scrum metrics** are specific data points that scrum teams track and use to improve efficiency and effectiveness. Scrum teams use metrics to inform decision-making and become more efficient in planning and execution, as well as set target goals and improvement plans.

## What is scrum?

**Scrum** is an agile framework and way of working that helps teams address complex problems, while iteratively developing solutions around a goal. 

-The scrum way of working is characterized by the [sprint](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/sprints), which is a measured amount of time a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work. 
- scrum metrics are increasingly important to measure team performance and effectiveness.

## What are scrum metrics?

**Scrum metrics** are specific data points that scrum teams track and use to improve efficiency and effectiveness. They can become insights that help guide and improve a team’s agile journey.

Scrum teams use metrics to inform decision-making and become more efficient in planning, execution, establishing a baseline on the status quo, and set target goals and improvement plans.
- Every team is unique: they can be different in size, technologies used, type of work they do, etc.
- It’s up to each team to agree on a set of metrics to track and define how to use them. 
- This is not an individual effort and not something the leadership or management can define and enforce on behalf of the teams.

## Why do you need scrum metrics?

- help teams establish benchmarks and guide the direction of the work.
- helps bring visibility to various dimensions of a team’s effectiveness, whether it’s a team’s velocity, capacity, predictability in delivery, or quality of the product. 
- Key metrics can cultivate awareness in the team’s performance and instigates action to change and improve.

## Can scrum metrics be used as KPIs?

-Scrum metrics can be used to set up key performance indicators (KPIs), but it depends on the type and scope of the work. 

-Scrum metrics alone cannot measure customer value or show if the team even delivered the right thing. 
-For an agile team, KPIs should ultimately show how well the team supports company priorities. 

When measuring a scrum team’s performance, other metrics outside those of the scrum should be considered, including: 

-   **Return on investment (ROI) to a business** — Companies measure this in numerous ways depending on the objectives, including growth in revenue, monthly active revenue (MAU), and more.
-   **Customer satisfaction** — Survey metrics like the Net Promoter Score (NPS) and customer satisfaction score (CSAT) can help track the success of a project. Consistent customer satisfaction metrics for every release are important to showing a scrum team’s value to customers.
-   **Team satisfaction** — Just by asking your team about their level of motivation with the project and engagement with the team, you can catch problems like turnover, attrition, and dissatisfied developers.

## Key scrum events and what metrics to review

While agile scrum defines several recurring events — sprint, sprint planning, daily scrum, sprint review, sprint retrospective — these don’t provide any guarantees of progress or success. However, each one allows team members to inspect and adapt how they work.

![Sprint cycle infographic](https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:ae9f40d1-19d8-42e4-8511-751708bb89d5/sprint-cycle.png?cdnVersion=1717)

### Sprint planning

**sprint planning** meeting is held at the beginning of a sprint where a team breaks down story descriptions into detailed tasks. 
- provides an estimate of work to be produced during a sprint. 
- There are a handful of data points that can make your team’s sprint planning more efficient, including sprint goals, current team velocity, team capacity, and type of work. 
- We use a [sprint planning meeting template](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/templates/sprint-planning-meeting) to help guide our sprint planning.

#### Sprint goals

**Sprint goals** help teams decide what to accomplish in a sprint, bring cohesion to the items, and set priorities. 
- often contribute to a bigger outcome than can be achieved through multiple sprints.
-  priority should be based on their impact to this outcome. 
-  review goals and priorities regularly to strategize how to sequence and split engineering efforts.

#### Team velocity

**velocity**: how much work it can accomplish during a given time, as well as capacity, or how much availability it has. A velocity chart, [like](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/view-and-understand-the-velocity-chart/), reveals the amount of value delivered during a sprint.
- helps us predict the volume of work a team can perform for future sprints. 
- A team’s velocity can only be understood after running a few sprints together as a team. 

 Over time velocity will stabilize as a result of a team working together due to:
- ramping up on technologies used 
- understanding each other’s expertise
- learning how to work as a team.

The following is an [example of a velocity chart](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/view-and-understand-the-velocity-chart/) with (1) estimation statistic based on story points, (2) commitment, which is an estimate of all issues in the sprint, (3) completed estimates, and (4) sprints completed.

![Velocity chart infographic](https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:742a35f3-070f-42d1-bdc4-abe381dcaf33/chart-1.png?cdnVersion=1717)

#### Team capacity

**Team Capacity**: the amount of work a team can complete in a sprint is based on its capacity and availability. 
- Stable velocity won’t mean anything if half of your team is off on a vacation.
- gather each team member’s availability a few sprints out and add the sum to get a percentage of total capacity. 
- Since last-minute changes or emergencies can happen to anyone, it’s also a good idea to leave a 10 percent buffer in your sprint commitment to avoid overcommitting and under-delivering.

#### Type of work

- Be intentional about what work your team is taking on by reviewing the split of different types of work during sprint planning. 
- In this case, even if you find a lot of tech debt and quality work in the backlog, you can solve it strategically by scheduling a tech debt sprint or raising the bar on QA.

### Stand-ups (a.k.a daily scrum)

**[Stand-ups](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/standups), or Daily Scrum**, are short meetings held each day where team members check in about their work.
- Should go beyond updates about an individual’s updates on their to-do list. 
- An opportunity to review a team’s sprint progress and realign priorities for making small to big daily decisions that can have a significant impact on a sprint’s outcome.

In doing so, the following data and metrics can come in handy:

#### Progress towards sprint goals

- a chance to discuss if the team is still on track. If not, why and what can be done about it?
- If it’s something that can’t be resolved, it’s important to communicate this to key stakeholders, so everyone is on the same page.

#### Sprint burndown

[sprint burndown chart](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/tutorials/burndown-charts). A 

**Sprint Burndown Chart** 
- Tracks the completion of work throughout a sprint.
- Compares the time and amount of work to complete, measured in story points or hours. 
- Helps predict a team’s ability to complete work in a designated time 
- helps track scope creep. 

If a burndown chart has a sharp drop, it could be related to an inaccurate estimate of work. 

![Sprint burndown chart infographic](https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:e8f08ad0-a316-4781-a59c-cee0e49ff6a7/sprint-burndown-chart.png?cdnVersion=1717)

#### Workload distribution

- don’t turn it into a weapon.
-  If you use this to measure an individual’s productivity, you can end up discouraging your team. 
-  create a safe environment for everyone to openly talk about how much they’re taking on, and where they need help.

### Sprint retrospective

**[Sprint Retrospectives]**(https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/retrospective) 
- you and your team review what happened in the sprint by celebrating what went well, what needs improvement, and why. 
- the perfect time and place for you to review key sprint metrics, including sprint goal completion and sprint satisfaction.

The following is an example of my team’s retrospective outlined on a Confluence page:

![Sprint retrospective screenshot](https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:48bc5981-3e7a-4812-8991-2f18aa0220f6/retrospective-meeting.jpeg?cdnVersion=1717)

### Sprint goal completion

 In evaluating your team’s success, scrum metrics we’ve already discussed can come in handy.
 
 Doing so will help your team address the issue and come up with a clearer action plan.

### Sprint satisfaction

- This is simply asking your team about their satisfaction with the sprint.
- Some teams use a number scale for this, anecdotal feedback, or even emojis/gifs.
-  Your team can reflect on team goals and if the type of work was in alignment with team goals. 

- encourage team members to speak up and call on them if needed.
- The best retrospectives have multiple perspectives and a variety of opinions. 
- By the end of the meeting, the team largely agrees on the top problems, owners, and a plan to follow up on key issues.
