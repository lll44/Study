# Markdown Cleanup Instructions

This is mindless busy work, so please take care of this in free down time while multitasking like a film or on a call.

1. There isn't any link artifacts in the grokking but run the following regex command in obsidian files needed to remove the link formatting from the document. 

```ad-note
This will nuke all the links on the page you apply this to, be very careful. So please make sure to save at least one link to the original webpage in [Name](link.com) format
```

2. You can delete code for Java & C++. If we ever learn the language we can go back and add it. 

3. Fixing the code blocks, just run it through 
- [Python Prettifier](https://codebeautify.org/python-formatter-beautifier)
- [Javascript Prettifier](https://codebeautify.org/jsviewer)

```ad-note
Make sure the code block matches the site!!!
```
