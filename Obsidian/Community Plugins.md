**Zettelkasten Exploration Analogy**

​    218 - Zettelkasten as a Knowledge Explorer  One way to better understand and think about the purpose of a [zettelkasten](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-zettelkasten/1999/2) is to compare it to an explorer. The index is your original port  city, the biggest hub where information is located and a place to branch off from. You aren’t just any explorer though, you also happen to be a cartographer.  Setting up outposts for further exploration. Output is a byproduct of the interaction between what he put in the  zettelkasten, his default brain, and how the two communicated with each  other.



1. **Reading Log.**  I really liked the idea of using Obsidian as a sort of Resonance Calendar when I read about them, so I’ve started using the Daily Notes & Calendar plugins to keep track of impactful media that I consume. I try to make sure I give a link and a top-level  summary of my major takeaways, because I rarely process these into  “proper” notes — the content is typically things I found interesting and relevant but taking formal notes on every interesting thing I learn  would not only be redundant, it would be a Sisyphean task of Herculean  proportions. Instead, I make sure my summary has enough information to  let me find it again if I need to, and then at the end of the month, I  concatenate all of my Reading Log notes (using this nifty javascript  that I’m working on turning into a plugin) into a single roundup file,  sort through everything to see if it really was worth sharing and  retaining, and then turn it into a blog post  [like this reading roundup 85](https://eleanorkonik.com/january-2021-reading-roundup/).

2. My reading roundups *also* include things I sought out deliberately for learning, and in those cases I usually create a **literature note** (in folder `53`). My literature notes are comprised primarily of highlights and  annotations; after I’m finished reading something, I export the  highlights and annotations and then reformat them to have descriptive  headings and numerical identifiers (typically based on chapter and  page/location) for easier interlinking. I try to *always* include a note for why I thought something would be useful, so my literature  notes tend to be several thousand words along the lines of:

3. **Matching**. Once I have a couple of different pieces  of information that connect to each other on a particular topic (often  from the same literature note, but sometimes I’ll come across something  that relates to a different piece of information I found), I’ll create a new note with a descriptive title *that makes the statement the references prove* and put it into my `56 Synthesis` folder. In most ways, the title is the important part. Then I’ll  transclude all of the relevant “academic” notes on that topic so I can  see them in one place. If it’s only one or two short things, I’ll leave  it alone for efficiency’s sake. But once it’s unwieldy, I’ll start  synthesizing things in one of two ways.

4. **Indexes.** I find the term “Map of Content” to be  pretty … fraught, so I like to avoid it. But I create an index whenever I have a concept that I’ve got a bunch of information about. My [weekly research roundup newsletter 34](https://eleanorkonik.com/subscribe/) gets saved off into a specialty folder because of the formal formatting I use, but they’re designed to be narrowly-focused deep overviews of my research on a particular topic, like wool or beetles or aerogels. I  write articles for my blog basically whenever I feel like I have an  insight worth sharing. I have reference notes and synthesis notes and…  well, information gets spread out. So my index notes are a good place to link to information on a topic *and summarize what that link contains* so I can get an easy, top-down view of my own notes as needed. This is  where Obsidian’s search really shines, because sometimes I find stuff I  had forgotten about, lol.

5. If I only have academic sources on a particular topic, though, and there are a bunch of them, I’ll usually create properly **synthesized** note, although the title is still the most important thing. To be  honest, I do this rarely — and usually purposefully (i.e. when I’m  specifically looking into something like Mesopotamian clothing), not  because I found a spontaneous connection. I find the idea of the “atomic note” to be largely irrelevant to me thus far; I prefer to think of the Zettelkasten ideal as “insights” or “epiphanies” and in terms of what I do, they’re relatively rare and more importantly almost always wind up  being fleshed out into an article of some kind — or they’re so short and self-evident that I never get beyond a descriptive title with some  reference links as sources.

6. More often, though, ideas I have wind up in `91 Seeds` (or `55 Questions!`) because ultimately, I like writing articles. I am a verbose person and I like sharing my thoughts with the world (obviously). So if a thought  about history strikes me while reading, and it could be useful for  worldbuilding or might be able to find an audience (which is almost  always) I usually want it down in pre-production, not languishing in my  “notes.” I even have a little “Article & Blog Idea” step file that I use to collect backlinks on literature notes and resonance calendar  when I don’t have the energy to create the seed. Then, once I have  enough sources or angles for a particular seed to push it to the point  where it’s worth tackling — or inspiration strikes — I usually open up a different markdown app, like Writemonkey or Typora, in one window, and  my obsidian vault in the other, and then open up all of my relevant  notes in Obsidian and start writing, or, secretly, sometimes I use  obsidian mobile to dictate a draft using voice text.

   Then, once I’m done, I go update the relevant `51 Index` notes.





#### Daily Notes

```
### {{date:dddd}} {{date:M/D}}
This makes up a portion of [[{{date:YYYY MMMM}}]]

#### Todo
- [ ] Hiya, Buddy!

---
#### Things that happened
- An occurrence or event

#### TIL
- Something I learned or of which I was informed

#### Questions
-

```

 

I fill in the gaps in between. Daily notes are a catch-all for me -  they can include my own summaries/analysis of interesting articles,  simply links to articles that may be interesting later with a few copied highlights, or the beginning musings of rough drafts of “real” notes  (even as short as a simple questions to look into further). I try to  review daily notes once per week, but otherwise don’t worry about their  longevity, with the assumption that whatever has merit will be converted into something more durable.

The key point for me is the #daily tag, which allows for easy filtering out of the graph and search.



#### Seedbox

It allows me to create a new note at any time with no fear of  “muddling” my curated notes. There doesn’t need to be any analysis  paralysis trying to decide how the note should be organized: it doesn’t  matter, yet.

It creates a natural separation between curated and uncurated  knowledge and ideas: if an item is outside my Seedbox, I know it has  received at least a baseline of consideration, and I know it has proven  itself valuable at least once in the past. In this metaphor, “seeds” are captured ideas. When you put a seed into  your seedbox, you are “planting” it, in the hopes that it will grow into an Understanding. The

#TODO:

#### Obsidian to Anki

In Anki, navigate to Tools->Addons->AnkiConnect->Config, and change it to look like this:

```
{
    "apiKey": null,
    "apiLogPath": null,
    "webBindAddress": "127.0.0.1",
    "webBindPort": 8765,
    "webCorsOrigin": "http://localhost",
    "webCorsOriginList": [
        "http://localhost",
        "app://obsidian.md"
    ]
}
```

Restart Anki to apply the above changes. With Anki running in the background, load the plugin. This will generate the plugin settings.

## Features

Current features (check out the  [Wiki](https://github.com/Pseudonium/Obsidian_to_Anki/wiki) for more details):

- **Custom note types** - You're not limited to the 6 built-in note types of Anki.

- **Updating notes from file** - Your text files are the canonical source of the notes.

- **Tags**, including **tags for an entire file**.

- **Adding to user-specified deck** on a *per-file* basis.

- **Markdown formatting**.

- **Math formatting**.

- **Embedded images**. GIFs should work too.

- **Audio**.

- **Auto-deleting notes from the file**.

- **Reading from all files in a directory automatically** - recursively too!

- **Inline Notes** - Shorter syntax for typing out notes on a single line.

- **Easy cloze formatting** - A more compact syntax to do Cloze text

- **Frozen Fields**

- **Obsidian integration** - A link to the file that made the flashcard, full link and image embed support.

- **Custom syntax**

  RemNote single-line style.

  ```
  This is how to use::Remnote single-line style
  ```

  Header paragraph style.

  ```
  # Style
  This style is suitable for having the header as the front, and the answer as the back
  ```

  Question answer style.

  ```
  Q: How do you use this style?
  A: Just like this.
  ```

  Neuracache #flashcard style.

  ```
  In Neuracache style, to make a flashcard you do #flashcard
  The next lines then become the back of the flashcard
  ```

  Ruled style

  ```
  How do you use ruled style?
  ---
  You need at least three '-' between the front and back of the card.
  ```

  Markdown table style

  ```
  | Why might this style be useful? |
  | ------ |
  | It looks nice when rendered as HTML in a markdown editor. |
  ```

  Cloze paragraph style

  ```
  The idea of {cloze paragraph style} is to be able to recognise any paragraphs that contain {cloze deletions}.
  ```

  Note that **all custom syntax is off by default**, and must be programmed into the script via the config file - see the Wiki for more details.

#### Extract URL Content

Operates in 2 modes.

1. **Selection** - If you select a URL in the document and execute these commands it will replace the selection with the markdown content.
2. **Document** - If you add front mater with the key of `link` to your document then it is treated as a linked document. Then calling extract will look for the link and replace the content of the document with the extracted content.

It can

- **Extract**: Replace url or document with readable markdown extracted from the sites html content
- **Title Only**: Replace url or document with a markdown anchor with the title extracted from the page content
- **Import from Clipboard**: Extract content from url that is found in your clipboard and dump it at your cursor

#### Find Unlinked Files

Call the command `Find unlinked files` and the file `Find unlinked files plugin output.md` will be created in your vault root and opened in a new pane.

#### Markdown Formatting Assistant

The Side Panel can be opened by the Ribbon Icon on the left side. If you changed the side (left or right) of the panel in the settings, just hit this butten/icon again and it will reload on the right side.

- Markdown Section
- HTML Section
- Latex Section
- Greek Letters Section

##### Command Language

With the command language the speed of the workflow can be specifically improved. By typing the trigger char (by default `\`) the commands will be activated and a suggestion window opens. It shows maximal 5 suggestions, which can be improved by adding more letters. The selected suggestion can be changed with the arrow keys and be activated with the enter key.

##### Color Picker

###### Select a color

The color picker provides an easy and fast workflow to work with colors. If you pick a color with the `Select a Color` button and leave the window (by clicking outside the color picker), the selected color will be inserted at the current courser position. In addition, it will be copied to the clipboard.

###### Color History

Furthermore, the color picker saves the history of the last 10 used colors.

###### Saved Colors

To Save the current color even if obsidian will be closed, just click the `Save Color` button.

###### Sort saved Colors

All saved colors can be sorted via drop a catch.

###### Delete a Color

To delete a saved or last used color just click it with the right mouse button.

###### Additonal Formats

For a even easier handling you can select additional options to what should be added to the color.

###### Options

- Add "color: {your color}"
  - ex. `color: #ffffff`
- Add "background-color: {your color}
  - ex. `background-color: #ffffff`
- Add tag: "style={your color}
  - This option is only helpful, if you also select one of both of the other options like:
  - ex. `style="background-color: #ff0000"`

#### Markdown Prettifier

The default hotkey is `Ctrl+Alt+L`.

- Hashtags janitor

```markdown
A #new and #exciting paragraph!
```

```markdown
---
tags:
    - '#new'
    - '#exciting'
---

A #new and #exciting paragraph!
```

- Autolink literals

- Normalizes ordered lists.

- Normalizes table formatting.

#### Note Refactor

3 options available:

1. Vault folder
2. Same folder as current file
3. Specified folder

A folder path set as `Zettels/{{date:YYYY}}/{{date:MMMM}}` will add a new file to the following folder structure:

##### Commands

###### Note Splitting

Splitting the current note from the current line into a new note or append to an existing one.

Weirdly, sometimes, new lines of text had a space infront of them. Such as: - Some text

...which resulted in Obisidian treating it as a sub-block of the preceding line.

To remove the space for those lines, I used a regular expression search-and-replace:

1. In "Find in current buffer" activate "Regex Search" (The `.*` icon)
2. Enter `^([ ]|\t)+` into the search field
3. Use the button "Replace" or "Replace All" to remove the space
