## Neuroplasticity super protocol.
Most things have been tested in humans. 

"Better living through chemistry still requires better living.""

Only behaviors and protocols can direct rewiring the brains that are adaptive are what’s important. 

### 1.  Get alert
You can not learn in your sleep, you need to be aware and alert and attempting to learn.

### 2.  Get focused
You need alertness to get focused. These two things combined allow us to be motivated. 

Background white noise that is tolerable can help stimulate this motivation by creating optimum brain conditions. 

If you draw a visual target at the distance they will learn and have them focus for 10-15 with blinking will help imitate this. This brings online the chemicals that bring along elevated alert and focus naturally. If your stressed you know you can focus in a millisecond.
  
### 3.  Generate repetitions. (As many as you safely can in a given block). 
Safety margins vary from music to running hurdles.
 

### 4.  Expect & Embrace Errors. 
Error creates heightened activity in the pre frontal cortex. Your attention increases when you miss, then your perception increases trying to fine tune errors. 

### 5.  Randomly Insert Micro-Rest Intervals
Don’t worry on optimal ratios, just introduce at random. 
  
### 6.  Random intermittentant reward
Sometimes the best reward is no reward at all. It will undermine their learning.

Dopamine reward prediction error. The more you experience that reward the more potent the next reward is gonna have to be higher.

### 7.  Limit Learning Trigger sessions to 90m or less (Space 2-3 Hours Apart)
The brain has a high caloric intake.

The molecules of alertness have a bias towards moving and agitation that are healthy forms of alertness. Then incorporate 

### 8.  Incorporate NSDR Protocols (10-30m). Post learning trigger sessions. 

For sake of enhancing plasticity and alertness. 
If naps interfere with your ability to sleep later. A 10m nap is great. 

### 9.  Maximize Quality & Optimal durations of sleep that night (& The next).
