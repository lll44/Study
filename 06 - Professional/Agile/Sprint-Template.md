# Workflow

To Do -> In Progress -> Review -> Done

- **To Do** Work that has not been started
- **In Progress** Work that is actively being looked at by the team
- **Review** Work that is completed and awaiting review
- **Done** Work that is completely finished and meets the team's definition of done

A well designed workflow answers the following questions:
-   What work has the team completed?
-   Is the backlog of work increasing or keeping pace with the team?
-   How many items are in each status?
-   Are there any bottlenecks that are slowing the team down?
-   How long does it take to complete an average task?
-   How many work items didn't pass our quality standards the first time around?



# Epics & Stories

A story is one simple narrative; a series of related and interdependent stories makes up an epic. Epics, in contrast, are few in number and take longer to complete. Teams often have two or three epics they work to complete each quarter. Initiatives are made up of epics.

Epic: March 2050 Launch
Story: Keep fuel tanks PSI > 250 PPM on launch
Story: Reduce overall fuel consumption by 1%.
Story: Hire new propulsion engineer to replace Gary.

Examples of an agile story:
-   iPhone users need access to a vertical view of the live feed when using the mobile app.
-   Desktop users need a “view fullscreen” button in the lower right hand corner of the video player.
-   Android users need to be linked to apple store.


#### Creating an agile epic
-   **Reporting** — Create epics for the projects that managers and executives will want to keep an eye on.
-   **Storytelling** — Use epics, and the stories that roll up into them, as a mechanism to tell the story of how you arrived at the current state of a feature or product.
-   **Culture** — Let organizational culture dictate the size and granularity of an epic.
-   **Time** — Most development teams rely on estimation frameworks instead of time, but it’s a worthwhile gut check to make sure your epics will take a couple weeks to complete. Not too long and not too short.

Break down an Epic

-   **User role or persona** — Create a unique story for each user persona. “Quicker login for new visitors,” “quicker login for return customers,” etc.
-   **Ordered steps** — Break down the process and create a story for each step.
-   **Culture** — Let team norms dictate if a story is a quick task or a week-long project.
-   **Time** — Barring another agreed-upon convention, design stories that can be completed in one print or less.


#### Stories 

**“As a [persona], I [want to], [so that].”**

Consider the following when writing user stories:
-   **Definition of “Done”** — The story is generally “done” when the user can complete the outlined task, but make sure to define what that is.  
-   **Outline subtasks or tasks** — Decide which specific steps need to be completed and who is responsible for each of them.  
-   **User personas** — For Whom? If there are multiple end users, consider making multiple stories.  
-   **Ordered Steps** — Write a story for each step in a larger process.  
-   **Listen to feedback** — Talk to your users and capture the problem or need in their words. No need to guess at stories when you can source them from your customers.  
-   **Time** — Many development teams avoid discussions of time altogether, relying instead on their estimation frameworks. Stories should be completable in one sprint, stories that might take weeks or months to complete should be broken up into smaller stories or should be considered their own epic.  



#### Story Points

**No individual task should be more than 16 hours of work.**

#### The definition of “done”

-   It’s important that teams have a clear definition of **“done”**.
-   This definition can be another type of artifact, which should be documented and shared.
-   An example definition of done for a development team is when code is covered with automated tests that match a specification and is deployed to a production environment.
-   A team without a clear definition of done will find themselves often in sprint review asking “is this done?” when reviewing open scrum tasks.
-   The definition of done helps define the boundaries of an **increment**.
-   **Increments** should be delivered in complete usable packages that are additive to increments that came before.
-   **Done** also defines when tasks are complete and can be closed out for burndown tracking.

## Retrospective

Using the burndown chart. 
-   you and your team review what happened in the sprint by celebrating what went well, what needs improvement, and why.
-   the perfect time and place for you to review key sprint metrics, including sprint goal completion and sprint satisfaction.
