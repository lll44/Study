## Schedule: 

This schedule is built using Dr. Andrew Huberman's

The actual setup for the learning interview is [[9 Step Protocol for Neuroplasticity and Learning - Huberman Lab]]

It's somewhat rigid but meant to have built in flexibility around breaks as point to recharge. 

This schedule should be somewhat regimented so we can obtain maximal velocity

Each study session will utilize an Ultradian Cycle which is the longest time someone can stay highly focused enough to rapidly learn something new without a break.

In ways we could possibly gamify this by betting stakes on certain que points to stay focused on accountability. 


#### Ultradian Cycle: 90m
- 5m - Planning.
	- Play white noise. 
	- Hide Phone in a different room
	- Limit all distractions
	- Create Todolist for this Cycle. Be specific and atomic for subtasks. Review with each other before starting working to clarify our goals and how we want to approach it. 
	- Put Ultradian Cycle Timer on one of the monitors. 

- 27m & 2m - Focused Work & Break. (3x)
	- Focused Sessions
		- You should not leave your seat or desk during the focused session. 
	- Break
		- Should be kept short, you don't want to context switch out of work. 
		- Optional: Meditate (focused point), stretch, use the bathroom, grab water, etc...  

- 20m - Break  
	- At the end of the study session we will;
		- Explain what we did.
		- Discuss any possible holds, bottlenecks or clarifications.
			- If these require longer discussion will be deferred to next session.
	- The break interval is open to do whatever, here you should check your phone, grab food, do whatever.
		- NSDR - Non Sleep Deep Rest for 20m helps learning retention highly.
