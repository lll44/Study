## Schedule: 

This schedule is built using Dr. Andrew Huberman's

The actual setup for the learning interview is [[9 Step Protocol for Neuroplasticity and Learning - Huberman Lab]]

It's somewhat rigid but meant to have built in flexibility around breaks as point to recharge. 





Each study session will utilize an Ultradian Cycle which is the longest time someone can stay high focused enough to rapidly learn something new without a break.

In ways we could possibly gamify this by betting stakes on certain que points to stay focus.
